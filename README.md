# MathJax Plugin for Github (Edge extesion)

This extension adds support for displaying LaTeX equations in GitHub repositories, rendering them with the open source [MathJax](http://mathjax.org/) library. For example, if you had it install you would see the following lovely equation: $e^{i \pi} + 1 = 0$

Right-Click on an equation to show MathJax's context menu with additional options, e.g. "Scale All Math..." to instantly scale all equations on a page, "TeX commands" to see the source TeX equation etc.
